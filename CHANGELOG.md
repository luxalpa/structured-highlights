# Structured Highlights Changelog

## 0.0.1

Initial release with:

- Rust support
- Configurable colors for blocks and highlights
- Configurable Transparency
- Configuration is currently not stored within the Color profile, and there is only a preset for light mode, so dark
  mode needs to be manually adjusted (very easy though)
